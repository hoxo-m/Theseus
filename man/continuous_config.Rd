\title{Continuous Variable Configuration for Theseus Plot}
\usage{
continuous_config(
  n = 10L,
  pretty = TRUE,
  split = c("count", "width", "rate"),
  breaks = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{integer. Number of bins to create for a continuous variable.}

\item{pretty}{logical. If TRUE, use pretty breaks for bin edges.}

\item{split}{string. Method for binning continuous variables. Options are:
- "count": divide the variable into bins with roughly equal number of observations.
- "width": divide the range of the variable into equal-width bins.
- "rate": divide based on differences in outcome rates between bins.}

\item{breaks}{numeric vector specifying custom break points.}
}
\value{
A list containing binning parameters (`n`, `pretty`, `split`, `breaks`)
  to be used in plotting or contribution calculations for continuous variables.
}
\description{
The `continuous_config()` function creates a configuration object for handling
continuous variables in Theseus Plots. It controls how continuous data is binned
into discrete categories for contribution calculations and visualization.
}
\examples{
continuous_config(n = 5, pretty = FALSE, split = "rate")
