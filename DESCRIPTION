Description: Provides tools for decomposing differences in rate metrics between
    two groups into contributions from individual subgroups and visualizing them
    as a "Theseus Plot". Inspired by the story of the Ship of Theseus, the method
    replaces subgroup data from one group with that of another step by step,
    recalculating the overall metric at each stage to quantify subgroup contributions.
    A Theseus Plot combines the stepwise progression of a waterfall plot with
    the comparative bars of a bar chart, offering an intuitive way to understand
    subgroup-level effects.
